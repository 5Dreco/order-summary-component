### What I learned

I didn't learn anything particularly new but I was incredibly happy to see how much I improved in the past months. This challenge would've been a struggle a while ago. After playing around with Bootstrap and trying out things on my own, I believe I'm finally comfortable handling images, and make them responsive as well!
